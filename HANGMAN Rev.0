"""This is a game copied from 'Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python'
   One player thinks of a word, and then draws a blank on the page for each letter
   in the word. Then the second player tries to guess letters that might be in the word.
   if they guess correctly, the first player writes the letter in the proper blank.
   if they guess incorrectly, the first player draws a single body part of the hanging man.
   if the second player can guess all letters in the word before the hangman is completely drawn,
   they win. But if they cannot figure it out in time, they lose."""
